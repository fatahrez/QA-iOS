Though they are often depicted as being present for Jesus' birth, the Bible specifies only an upper limit of two years for the interval between the birth and the visit (Matthew 2:16),The association of magi with kings—a connection vehemently opposed by John Calvin as a \"ridiculous contrivance\"—comes from attempts to tie Old Testament prophecies such as Psalm 72 and chapter 60 of the Book of Isaiah, to the magi; most accounts describe the magi as being astrologers or magicians.",

The only reason why an object orbiting a planet remains in orbit is because the object is being influenced by the planet's gravity, and gravitational fields still exist even in the depths of intergalactic space. At an altitude of 400 kilometres (250 mi), equivalent to a typical orbit of the International Space Station, the Earth's gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the surface Astronauts in space experience weightlessness not because of a lack of gravity but because they are orbiting Earth in constant free-fall. While in orbit, spacecraft may not even experience zero G-forces; on the International Space Station, for example, small G-forces come from tidal effects, gravity from objects other than the Earth such as astronauts, spacecraft, and other celestial bodies, as well as air resistance and internal movements that impart momentum to the space station.",
